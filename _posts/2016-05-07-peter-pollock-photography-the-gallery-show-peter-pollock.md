<article style=""><h1>Peter Pollock Photography - The Gallery Show - Peter Pollock Photography</h1><p>Surreal. That's the only word I can use to describe the experience of seeing my photo's lining the walls of a gallery - and that doesn't even begin to describe how it feels to see people coming in to view them. My life has been made up of some surreal moments these past few years.</p><img src="http://photo.peterpollock.com/wp-content/uploads/wp_photo_seller/8/h6toeybn0a/IMG_5071.jpg" /></article>
